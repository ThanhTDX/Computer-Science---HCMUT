1.2. Climate data collection
numbers between brackets represent the standard deviation.
the datas were obtained from weather stations and measurement boxes and recored by  the central climate computer.
For the missing outdoor climate variables:
CO2_out			668mg m-3
T_sky			
T_SoOut			equations presented in the detailed model description
CO2 injection rate and CO2 concentration of the greenhouse air were measured throughtout the year

1.3 Determination of model performance (RRMSE) (for validation) (refer to page 32 part 2.4.4 for the exact formula)
For developing the methodology of optimal greenhouse design, it was assumed that an RRMSE of 10% or less would be sufficient

2 Results	(refer to page 32 of Van11) 

DOY			267-272		293-298
Flux(m3 m-2 s-10)	-		-
T_air			3.5		6.6
VP_air			7.0		8.9
CO2_air			7.1		11.7

All values were calculated and validated using RRMSE

=> This Model is valid (at which will be apllied to chapter 3 and chapter 8)
